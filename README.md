# Travel Bucket list

Live demo: https://thirajanas.github.io/my-travel-bucket-list/

## Why I Built This
I keep a running list of places I want to visit, and I wanted something simple, fast, and pretty to look at. This little app is my personal travel wish list, built with React + Vite so it feels snappy while I add and update destinations.

## What It Does
- Add destinations I want to visit
- Keep the list neat and easy to scan
- Works nicely on mobile and desktop

## Built With
- React
- Vite
- CSS

## Run It Locally

### You’ll Need
- Node.js (LTS recommended)

### Setup
1. Install dependencies:
	- `npm install`

2. Start the dev server:
	- `npm run dev`

3. Build for production:
	- `npm run build`

4. Preview the build:
	- `npm run preview`

## Project Notes
- `src/` holds the app code
- `public/` is for static files

## Deployment
Hosted on GitHub Pages. If the repo name changes, update the `base` path in `vite.config.js`.

## Ideas I Might Add Later
- Categories (beaches, mountains, cities, etc.)
- Make an area where I can type notes for each place
- A few subtle animations
- Make the list more compact (smaller cards/rows)
